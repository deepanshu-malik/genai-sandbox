    "\n",
    "1. **Embeddings capture meaning** - \"vacation\" matches \"PTO\" even with different words\n",
    "2. **One-time cost** - Embed documents once, query many times\n",
    "3. **Semantic search** - Finds relevant content based on meaning, not keywords\n",
    "4. **Token efficiency** - Only send relevant docs to LLM, not everything\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 This is RAG!\n",
    "\n",
    "You just experienced the core of RAG:\n",
    "- **R**etrieval: Find relevant docs using embeddings\n",
    "- **A**ugmented: Add those docs to the prompt\n",
    "- **G**eneration: LLM generates answer based on retrieved context\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📝 Experiment Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add your own documents to the `documents` list in Cell 3\n",
    "2. Try questions that don't match any document - see how scores drop\n",
    "3. Modify `top_k` to send multiple documents to the LLM\n",
    "4. Compare costs: RAG vs sending all documents every time"
